Bank Telemarketing success depends solely on clients subscribing to a term deposit or not. Taking a data-driven approach can be used to predict whether the bank telemarketing is indeed successful or not. Banks will need to assess whether this form of telemarketing is effective and whether to keep on this business path. This paper applies a Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LGBM) model to predict if a client has subscribed to a term deposit or not. The methods are implemented on a dataset provided by the bank through multiple telemarketing calls to prospective clients. When comparing models, there were varied results, however Light Gradient Boosting Machine and Gradient Boosting Classifier scored the highest.
